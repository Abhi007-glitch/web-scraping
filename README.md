# web-scraping



**Why builded this project**?                                                                                                                                        
Knowing the different way to gather data is very a very important skill set one should be having.

**What is web-scraping?**

In today's era a huge amont of digital data is being generated every second and available on Internet, So the process of extracting the desired data from any web page or application is Web Scraping.

As I am very much intrested in Cricket and maybe you might be too.

I Scrapped Cricket WorldCup 2019 data from Web(Cricinfo) and **wrote the data into pdf, excel containing respective matches
details**. 


In this project I have used **Axios for making request, excel4node for generating, writing excel file and pdf-lib for
creating & writing pdf**.
                             


This Project gaved me a good insight of DOM and helped me learn various JavaScript methods to point to a particular data.
